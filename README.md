# Titanic-Data-Analytics-Challenge-Day-10-Final-Documentation
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python. The project demonstrates data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and insight generation to uncover patterns that influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

 Project Overview:
 This project was created as part of the Python Data Analytics Coding Challenge (Day 10 – Final
 Integration) using the Titanic dataset. The objective is to analyze passenger demographics, class,
 and survival outcomes using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
 
 Tools & Libraries Used:
 Python 3, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
 
 Key Steps:
 1. **Data Import & Cleaning** – Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and verified data
 types. 2. **Exploration** – Used head(), info(), describe(), and value_counts() for dataset
 understanding. 3. **Visualization** – Plotted survival by gender and class, age and fare distribution,
 and correlation heatmap. 4. **Insights** – Identified key survival trends and correlations.
 
 Key Insights:
 - Females and first-class passengers had the highest survival rates. - Fare positively correlates with
 survival probability. - Lower-class passengers faced higher mortality rates.
 
 Learnings:
 This project enhanced understanding of real-world data analysis through: - Cleaning and
 preprocessing of missing or inconsistent data. - Statistical analysis and visual storytelling. - Deriving
 actionable insights from exploratory data analysis (EDA).
